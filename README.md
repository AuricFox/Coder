# Coder

Coder is a personal project designed to help me practice and experiment with building a full-stack application and experiment with other concepts. The topics focus primarily on computer science and mathematics. Other features include tools I have built or frameworks I am experimenting with.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AuricFox/Coder.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```
    cd flask_template
    ```

3. **Setup Environment:**
    ```
    pip install virtualenv  
    virtualenv env

    .\env\Scripts\activate      # Windows
    source env/bin/activate     # Mac OS
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```
    (env) pip install flask python-dotenv
    ```

5. **Run Server:**
    ```
    (env) python wsgi.py
    ```

    The server will start running, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. NOTE: Restart the server if any changes are made to any of the py or html files.

6. **Deactive Environment:**
    ```
    (env) deactivate
    ```
