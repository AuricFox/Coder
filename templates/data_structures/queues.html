            In computer science, a "queue" is another common data structure used to store a collection 
            of elements. Unlike a stack, a queue is a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure, which 
            means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A queue has two primary operations: enqueue and dequeue. The enqueue operation adds an 
            element to the back of the queue, while the dequeue operation removes the element at the 
            front of the queue. Other common operations on a queue include peek, which returns the front 
            element without removing it, and isEmpty, which checks if the queue is empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list. When using an array, the front 
            and back of the queue are represented by the indices of the first and last elements, 
            respectively. When using a linked list, the front and back of the queue are represented by 
            the first and last nodes in the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            Queues are commonly used in operating systems and networking systems to manage tasks and 
            messages. For example, when a printer receives multiple print jobs at once, it may use a 
            queue to store the jobs in the order they were received and print them one at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like a stack, a queue can also have a limited capacity, determined by the underlying data 
            structure used to implement it. If the queue becomes full and an element is enqueued, a queue 
            overflow error can occur. To prevent this from happening, many implementations of a queue 
            include a size limit or dynamic resizing capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            In summary, a queue is another fundamental data structure in computer science that stores a 
            collection of elements in a specific way. It has two primary operations, enqueue and dequeue, 
            and is commonly used in operating systems and networking systems to manage tasks and messages.
